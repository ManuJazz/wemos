# wemos
Several Wemos implementations that approach programmers to first steps in IoT/Arduino development

## Ejer01_blink
This exercise includes the simple task of blinking the LED in Wemos Shield. It's the perfect way to begin.
If you're using Arduino IDE and Wemos Shield has not been added, it's necesary to follow the next steps:
1. File -> Preferences -> Additional Boards Manager URLs: http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json
2. Tools -> Boards -> Boards Manager -> "esp" -> Install: esp8266 by esp8266 Community

## Ejer 03_LED_Phone
This exercise allows to interact with the LED Shield connected to Wemos using the phone and a Wifi connection.
In order to recognize the LED Shield, it's necesary to add Adafruit Neopixel library.
1. Sketch -> Include Library -> Manage Libraries -> "Adafruit Neopixel" -> Adafruit Neopixel by Adafruit (Arduino Library for controlling Simple-wire based LED pixels and strip)
